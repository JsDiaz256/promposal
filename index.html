        <!-- Letter page -->
        <div class="letter hidden" id="letter-page">
            <p>I guess this has almost become a tradition, huh? For every big, romantic event, I write a big, romantic letter. I've never been good with words, so I'll try to explain the impossibility of you with math and science. Hopefully you can see what you mean to me by the end of this. </p>
            <p>When I'm with you, it feels like 7x7=49, like 4x8=32, like 3x7=21. Like d/dx x = 1, like d/dx e^x = e^x, like d/dx int f(x) dx = f(x). Like the derivative of position is velocity, and the derivative of velocity is acceleration. You feel like drawing benzene, like Hess‚Äôs Law, like an acid and base forming a neutral solution. When I'm with you, everything feels like an exhale, like everything's clicked into place. Something so new and yet it feels like I've known it my whole life.</p>
            <p>You feel like reaching equilibrium. When I'm with you, it feels like putting one foot in front of the other while going downhill, and even if I crash and burn when I reach the bottom, the exhilaration as I put one foot in front of the other, rushing towards my doom makes it all worth it. You are a supernova, beautiful, incomprehensible and impossibly bright. You are a black hole, drawing my gaze and my thoughts in until my every waking moment is just you, you, you</p>
            <p>I think I'll love a bit of you forever. Long after we've left Trinity, long after college, long after we've gotten jobs and started paying bills, long after.</p>
            <p>I'll always love a part of you, the memory of you, the aftertaste of your presence in my mind. I'll love you like the sun loves the moon, like planets love the stars, like the ocean loves the sand, like hydrogen loves iodine. </p>
            <p>You make me brave and yet so incredibly scared. I'm brave enough to tell you I overthink a lot. I'm too scared to tell you every time I do, because what if you think I'm being annoying or oversharing or trauma dumping, what if you're just being polite and don't actually want to hear all that, what if some of the things I'm thinking about are true and that means all of them are true. </p>
            <p>I'm brave enough to interrupt your robotics meeting because I just want to see you one last time before I go home. I'm too scared to text you to come hug me when you're in a robotics meeting because what if it's more important to you than I am, what if you see my text and put your phone back down, what if you don't see it and I go home sad and you feel bad, what if you're busy and simply can't, what if what if what if.</p>
            <p>I'm brave enough to snark back at Sanjiv whenever he suggests we're not a real couple because we don't do PDA. I'm too scared to ask if my arguing makes you more uncomfortable because what if I'm making a big deal out of nothing, what if it's bothering me more than it bothers you, what if what if. </p>
            <p>I'm brave enough to make you bouquets and heartfelt letters and give you small trinkets to show how much you mean to me. I'm too scared to ask if it's enough, if it's too much, if it's not what you wanted, if there's some piece I'm missing because what if I've been focusing on the wrong things, what if there's something you don't like about this that you're not comfortable telling me, what if I'm making you uncomfortable with telling me if I'm doing something wrong, what if. </p>
            <p>I'm brave enough to tell you I want to kiss you. I'm too scared to follow through. What if I'm reading a situation wrong, what if you're not ready, what if I'm pushing your boundaries, what if I'm forgetting something you've told me, what if I do something wrong and it's not what you need or want and I hurt you, what if what if what if what if. </p>
            <p>And yet, you calm my racing thoughts like a seaside breeze. I feel like I'm finally getting the hang of this, of being us, which is such a shame because graduation is so soon, and then the summer, and then college. And maybe we won't ever be the same once that happens, maybe it won't even be us, but just you and me. But I want to cherish the us that we are right now. I want to lose myself in you without worrying about missteps. </p>
            <p>And I think you do too. Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but maybe I'm not. So, I'll ask this now, and if you want me to, I'll ask it 100 times over, and if not, I could never ask again, and if you want me to, I could act without asking, and if not, I could wait until you tell me to. You can say whatever you want to this. Maybe I'm making a bigger deal out of this than it needed to be, and maybe I'm making exactly as big a deal as we needed. But long story short, I just want to ask one thing:</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>.</p>
            <p>..</p>
            <p>...</p>
            <p>..</p>
            <p>.</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p>Can I kiss you?</p>
